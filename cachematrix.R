## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your functions do
## The overall goal of my two functions is to cahce a result in order to save
## save computing time for finding the inverse of a matrix.
## The first funciton assigns the variables and creates the cache.
## The second variable first checks to see if the calculation has been cached, if not
## it performs the calculation.

## Write a short comment describing this function

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  
}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
